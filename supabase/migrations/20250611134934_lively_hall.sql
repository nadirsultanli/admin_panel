  # Fix RLS Policies for Service Role Access

  1. Changes
    - Add service role bypass policies for all tables (checking for existence first)
    - Fix customer and product policies to allow proper creation
    - Simplify RLS policies for better usability
    - Ensure authenticated users can perform necessary operations

  2. Security
    - Maintains security while enabling proper functionality
    - Allows service role to bypass RLS for administrative functions
    - Enables proper user authentication flow
